Here's an example of how you could write JUnit tests for the Java method that calculates the average temperature from an array of daily temperature readings:

import org.junit.Test;

public class AverageTemperatureTest {

    @Test
    public void testAverageTemperature() {
        double[] temperatures = {78, 65, 34, 90, 45};
        double expectedAverage = 59.2;
        double actualAverage = AverageTemperature.getAverageTemperature(temperatures);
        assertEquals(expectedAverage, actualAverage, 0.01);
    }

}

The test method uses the JUnit annotation @Test to indicate that it should be run when the test suite is executed. It creates an array of temperature readings, passes it to the getAverageTemperature method, and then compares the result with the expected value.

Note that the test method uses the JUnit assertion method assertEquals to compare the actual and expected values. The third parameter specifies the tolerance for floating-point comparisons. In this case, we use a tolerance of 0.01, which means that the actual and expected values must be within 0.01 of each other to be considered equal.

You can also append markdown formatting for code by enclosing the code in backticks (\`) like this: \`System.out.println("Hello, world!");\`.
