There are currently 2 applications under the banner of App Connect:
* App Connect Personal
* App Connect Professional

App Connect Personal (usually just called App Connect) is our iSaaS solution that connects your SaaS applications so that when something happens in one application, a change is made automatically in another system.  For example, you might connect your Eventbrite application to your MailChimp account so that when someone signs up to your event in Eventbrite, they're automatically added to a mailing list in MailChimp.

App Connect Professional is our iPaaS offering, and includes all the web-based designer experience of App Connect that is used to create integrations (flows and APIs), as well as the Eclipse-based studio experience that is used to create orchestrations (previously Cast Iron Studio). The current dashboard shows the operational status of flows (and will soon show APIs, too).  In the future, the App Connect Professional dashboard will probably also show orchestrations and IIB on Cloud BAR files.  App Connect Professional also contains the web management console which is the web-based management console that existed in the previously-known-as Cast Iron experience.

We worked with Design to create some pages in Wordpress that describe what App Connect is/does: [https://www.appconnect.ibmcloud.com/](https://www.appconnect.ibmcloud.com/)  To find out more about App Connect, click the **Learn More** button under App Connect Personal.  The **Read more** links on the carousel pages give you some examples of applications that you can connect.  

The **Resources** menu on this page links to our [FAQ](https://developer.ibm.com/integration/docs/app-connect/faq/?cm_mc_uid=00299038643214817045684&cm_mc_sid_50200000=1484741040) and [tutorials](https://developer.ibm.com/integration/docs/app-connect/tutorials-for-ibm-app-connect/?cm_mc_uid=00299038643214817045684&cm_mc_sid_50200000=1484741040) pages, which are hosted on developerWorks, and a [forum](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/topics/app_connect.html?cm_mc_uid=00299038643214817045684&cm_mc_sid_50200000=1484741040) on dWAnswers.  We (the content squad) own and maintain these pages, which are also accessible from a hamburger menu after you've signed in to App Connect.  Design has control of the Wordpress pages.
